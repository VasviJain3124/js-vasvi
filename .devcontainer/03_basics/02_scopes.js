//     //scope and global scope as we have created function one but humne function two wala element function 2 ke bahar use krke 
//     // print krana chaha but what will happen ki wo nhi hoga because function two apne aap mei ek scope hai so wo function 2 ke bahar
//     // even if its included in function 1 will still throw error and eroor ke bad to kuch orint hota nhi hai
